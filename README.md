# Fourier-Series-FFT-Analysis
A Python-based Jupyter Notebook project for computing and visualizing Fourier series coefficients of periodic functions using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Includes examples with sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves, along with interactive visualizations to demonstrate convergence with varying harmonic terms.
