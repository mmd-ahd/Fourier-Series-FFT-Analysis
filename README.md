# Fourier-Series-FFT-Analysis
A Python-based Jupyter Notebook project for computing and visualizing Fourier series coefficients of periodic functions using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Includes examples with sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves, along with interactive visualizations to demonstrate convergence with varying harmonic terms.
## Project Overview
Explores Fourier series decomposition of periodic signals using NumPy and Matplotlib, leveraging FFT for efficient coefficient calculation.

## Features

FFT-based coefficient computation.

Visualization of true functions vs. Fourier approximations.

Support for common waveforms (sine, sawtooth, triangle).

Parameter customization (period, sample points, harmonic terms).

## Examples
Preconfigured tests for sine, sawtooth, and triangle waves with dynamic plotting.

## Methodology
Uses Nyquist sampling and np.fft.rfft for real-valued coefficient extraction.
